The File class is Javaâ€™s representation of a file or directory pathname. Because file and directory names have different formats on different platforms, a simple string is not adequate to name them. The File class contains several methods for working with the pathname, deleting and renaming files, creating new directories, listing the contents of a directory, and determining several common attributes of files and directories.
